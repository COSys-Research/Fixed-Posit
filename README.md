# Fixed-Posit

## Description

This repository contains code used in experiments of the paper "Fixed-Posit: A Floating-Point Representation for Error-Resilient Applications" published in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II.

The directory structure is as follows:
- pintool: Contains the pintool that replaces single-precision IEEE-754 multiplications with fixed-posit multiplications
- scripts: Contains various scripts used to run experiments 

## How to setup?
- Download [Intel Pin](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html). Our pintool is tested with Pin 3.17.
```bash
# Download this repo
git clone https://github.com/COSys-Research/Fixed-Posit.git

# Copy the pintools folder inside Pin's tools folder
# $PIN_HOME is set to the root directot of Intel Pin
cp -r Fixed-Posit/pintool/ $(PIN_HOME)/source/tools/

#Build the fixedpositmul pintool
cd $(PIN_HOME)/source/tools/pintool
make
# This would create a obj-intel64 or obj-ia32 folder with fixedpositmul.so file depending on your machine's architecture.
```

Create two new directories somewhere on your system: one to store the outputs of OpenBLAS benchmarks and the other to store the logs of multiplication operands generated by the pintool.
```bash
cd (OPENBLAS_PATH)/benchmark/

# outputs directory to store the outputs/results of the OpenBLAS benchmarks
mkdir outputs

# logs directory to store the logs of mutliplication operands generated by the fixedpositmul pintool
mkdir logs
```

## How to run?
### How to get error?
First, edit the `openblas_benchmark_path`, `pin_root`, `pintool_path`, `log_folder` variables in the scripts `script_maker_openblas.py` and `error_script_openblas.py` to point to the appropriate directories in your system.

Next run the following:
```
python3 script_maker_openblas.py
# Running this would generate a shell script run_openblas_exps.sh in the benchmark directory of OpenBLAS 
cd (OPENBLAS_PATH)/benchmark/

sh run_openblas_exps.sh
# Running this shell scripts will run the fixedpositmul pintool with OpenBLAS benchmark and store the results and logs in outputs and logs folder respectively. 

python3 error_script_openblas.py
# Running this scripts will compute the average relative error for all workloads for all fixed-posit configurations.
```

The computed errors are reported in the generated `comphrehensive_error_openblas.csv` file.
